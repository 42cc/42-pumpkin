Feature: Use suport functions
    As a pumpkin developer
    In order to show support of teardown/setup
    I want to make some example with it

    Scenario: Supports that are printing
        Given I wrote some support-functions
        And They print what they are doing
        Then it`s cool

    Scenario: Supports that are printing again
        Given As i told you, I wrote some functions
        And They print what they are doing each time feature runs
        Then Realy, it`s cool
